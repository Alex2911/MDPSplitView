# NSSplitViewTest

This is a demo project to try animate an `NSSplitView` while collapsing/expanding one of its panes.

Test steps:

1. Launch the app
2. Press Cmd-Opt-S to collapse/expand the source list

The source list should animate closed nicely. The split view should appear to move over the source list.

Check Mail.app for the desired appearance.
